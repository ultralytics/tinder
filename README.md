## Status Codes üí°

| Status Code | Explanation                                                                 |

## Config File Setup üîß

### Facebook Access Token and User ID

Add your Facebook credentials to your config file. `fb_auth_token.py` will retrieve your `facebook_access_token` and `fb_user_id`. These are imperative for generating your `tinder_auth_token`, which provides access to your Tinder account.

### SMS Authentication

SMS authentication is simple. Run `phone_auth_token.py`, enter your phone number, then provide the code received via SMS. Due to SMS rate limits, it's best to use your token (valid for 24 hours) rather than request a new one each time. Update `tinder_config_ex.py` with your token.

Programmatic retrieval of the `facebook_token` is now possible with the tools provided by [philliperemy](https://github.com/philipperemy/Deep-Learning-Tinder/blob/master/tinder_token.py) and [gloriamacia](https://github.com/gloriamacia). They've also added a Jupyter notebook to simplify the process further.

## Key Features üìä

### Match Info:

Creates a local dictionary per match with details like messages, age, photos, message count, and more.

```javascript
{
  "123456": {
    ...
  },
  "56789": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Sorting:

Sort your matches by attributes such as "age", "message_count", and "gender".

```javascript
[
  ("123456789123456789", {
    ...
  })
]
```

## Deprecated Features ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Note**: Certain features, such as sorting by `ping_time`, are no longer available due to changes by Tinder.
