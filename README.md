# Tinder API Documentation (Updated 2018) üíò

A big thank you to [@rtt](https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467#file-tinder-api-documentation-md) for their initial compilation of the Tinder API documentation. This document is meant to offer an updated guide for interacting with the Tinder API as of June 2018.

[![Ultralytics Actions](https://github.com/ultralytics/tinder/actions/workflows/format.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ultralytics/tinder/actions/workflows/format.yml) <a href="https://ultralytics.com/discord"><img alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/1089800235347353640?logo=discord&logoColor=white&label=Discord&color=blue"></a>

Please note that this documentation may become outdated over time; always refer to the latest API specifications when developing applications.

## API Details

The following table summarizes the host and protocol details for the Tinder API.

| Detail   | Value            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Host     | api.gotinder.com |
| Protocol | SSL              |

## Required Headers

When making API calls, it's essential to include appropriate headers. Here are the headers that you'll need:

| Header       | Example                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| X-Auth-Token | See "How to get facebook_token" section below |
| Content-type | application/json                              |
| User-agent   | Tinder/7.5.3 (iPhone; iOS 10.3.2; Scale/2.00) |

## Known Endpoints

All endpoints should be appended to the host URL, `https://api.gotinder.com`. Make sure to include the required headers with your requests. The only exception is the `/auth` endpoint, which should not be provided with the `X-Auth-Token` header.

The table below lists various endpoints with their purposes, expected data, and the HTTP method to use.

| Endpoint                                    | Purpose                                                | Data                                                       | Method |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |

| `/auth/login/accountkit`                    | For SMS authentication (two-factor)                    | `{'token': <token>, 'id': <id>, 'client_version':'9.0.1'}` | POST   |

(For the full list of endpoints, please refer to the attached table in the original documentation.)

## Status Codes

Tinder API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request:

| Status Code | Explanation                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | Everything went okay, and the server returned a result (if any).                                                                   |
| 301         | The server is redirecting you to a different endpoint. This can occur when a domain name changes or an endpoint's name is updated. |
| 400         | The server thinks you made a bad request. This happens when the request is missing information or is otherwise malformed.          |
| 401         | The server thinks you're not authenticated. This happens when incorrect credentials are provided.                                  |
| 404         | The server didn't find the resource you tried to access.                                                                           |

## Config File

### Facebook Access Token and User ID

To authenticate using your Facebook account, include your Facebook username and password in the config file. The `fb_auth_token.py` module will programmatically retrieve your `facebook_access_token` and `fb_user_id`, which are then used to generate a `tinder_auth_token` via `tinder_api.py`, granting you access to your Tinder data. Happy swiping! üéâ

### SMS Authentication

SMS authentication is straightforward. Run `phone_auth_token.py` and input your phone number when prompted. Enter the code you receive via SMS to retrieve your token. Keep in mind that there is a rate limit for the number of SMS you can receive in an hour. It's advised to use your token within its lifetime (24 hours) instead of requesting a new one each time.

To proceed, add your token to `tinder_config_ex.py` as the value for `tinder_token`. You're now prepared to start using the API!

## Key Features

#### Match Info üìä

This feature creates a local dictionary for each of your matches containing keys like message count, age, name, photos, and more. For example:

```javascript
{
  '123456': {
    // Detailed info about the match would go here.
  },
  // More matches would follow.
}
```

#### Sorting üîç

Sort your matches by attributes such as "age", "message_count", and "gender". Here's a sample structure:

```javascript
[
  // Tuple with match ID and corresponding match info.
];
```

#### Friends' Pingtimes (Unavailable)

The `friends_pingtimes()` function used to return the time since each Facebook friend last used Tinder. However, Tinder's change to a constant `ping_time` has made this feature obsolete.

#### Facebook Friends (Unavailable)

This feature used to allow you to access profile information and ID of your Facebook friends on Tinder. With the ID, you could call `api.get_person(id)` to get more detailed information. This feature is no longer available.
